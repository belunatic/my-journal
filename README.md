## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript

I developed a dynamic website utilizing HTML, custom CSS, and Tailwind CSS for design, complemented by JavaScript for data handling. The project leverages the LocalStorage API to personalize user experience by storing journal entries and usernames. With each new entry or profile update, JavaScript dynamically updates the HTML DOM, creating an interactive rendering effect. A standout feature is the ‘Inspiration Button,’ which generates thoughtful journaling prompts when users need a creativity boost.
## Lessons Learned:

I utilized the LocalStorage API to see its incredible potential for storing and accessing local data. This experience showcased how powerful this feature can be, paving the way for more complex and engaging projects in the future.
